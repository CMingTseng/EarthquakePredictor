This is an experimental project for earthquake prediction. Using the build-in magnetic field sensor of the device, the app stores the sensed data in the /Document/Quake/ directory. When a sudden change of the field is detected, a warning button is shown and the screen is captured. 

*** NOTE : This is a test experiment. No warranty is provided by the prediction results.
